# The Best Planner

## Description 
This app serves as a convenient day organizer for the user. By inputting tasks or events into designated blocks and saving them, the user can efficiently manage their schedule for the day. The header displays the current date, and the color-coded system helps differentiate between past and future events based on the user's local time.

## Usage
To utilize this tool, enter the event name and any relevant details into the corresponding block at the time of the event, and then click the "save" button located on the right side of that block. In case you need to modify the text, simply make the necessary changes and don't forget to save again. Good Luck!
